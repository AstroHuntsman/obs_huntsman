/*
 * sorts an array by Shell or insertion sort, whicever is deemed faster, and
 * finds the mean and quartiles.
 *
 * If the number of points is less than MBTHRESH (or MBTHRESH is -ve),
 * it uses all the data; otherwise it finds the quartiles for the main
 * body of the histogram, and reevaluates the mean for the main body.
 *
 * This routine is normally used in the inner cells, where no trimming is
 * used as there are too few points to play rejection games, or the outer
 * cells if it is deemed that Shell sort would be faster than the histogram
 * sort. In that case, the mean would already have been determined with
 * region_maxmean_crude, and WE DO NOT RECOMPUTE IT HERE; if ps->sum is
 * nonzero, the mean calculation is SKIPPED.
 *
 * The quartile algorithm is the same as used in
 * get_quartiles_from_array() and returns identical results; the ansatz is
 * that the data are distributed uniformly in the histogram cells, and
 * the quartiles are thus linearly interpolated in the cumulative histogram.
 * This is about as good as one can do with dense histograms, and for sparse
 * ones is as good as anything.
