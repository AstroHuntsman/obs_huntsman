--- Dustin pulled out the photo deblender, doing considerable violence to it
along the way.  Mostly, whole source files were pulled in.  Things I had to fake
are in  "fake.c".  The most significant thing is the cell profile-fitting code
from cellfitobj.c -- since the deblender doesn't need to galaxy profiles, only PSFs,
great violence was done.

Photo uses "makeprof.c" to create a cache file of compiled profiles.


(BEFORE)

phFitCellAsPsfFake
  phProfileExtract      -- objc -> CELL_STATS
  phProfileMean
  setup_cell_data       -- CELL_STATS -> fit_ctx
  cell_fit_psf
    cell_fit_model
      psf_cells_make

(AFTER)

phFitCellAsPsfFake
  phProfileExtract      -- objc -> CELL_STATS cstats
  phProfileMean
  phCellProfSet         -- CELL_STATS cstats -> CELL_PROF fit_ctx
  cell_fit_psf_model
       psf_cells_make   --   psf --> COMP_CSTATS
       --> touches fit_ctx




CELL_PROF -- in phExtract.h
CELL_STATS -- in phExtract.h



phInitProfileExtract() -- sets up "cellgeom", etc
CELL_STATS* phProfileGeometry() -- retrieves partial CELL_STATS with geometry set.

phGetCellid() ?
CELL_STATS* phProfileGetLast() -- returns &cstats global

phObjectNewFromProfile?
phProfileExtract -- REGION to CELL_STATS
