\subsection{Introduction}

After the bright objects are found, they are matched together in a merged 
object list in this module.  This module is the same as Merge Colors, except
it operates on different lists.

\subsection{Input}

\subsubsection{Object lists in each color}

This is the output of Find Bright Objects

\subsubsection{Offsets}

This is the offsets calculated in Calculate Offsets

\subsubsection{Matching parameters}

These parameters might include things like how closely two objects must
be in order to call them the same object.

\subsection{Output}

\subsubsection{Merged object list}

\subsection{Modules}

\subsubsection{Merge lists}

Use the offset to match the elements of the input lists to form the
output list.

\subsection{Algorithms}

We will use an algorithm similar to the prototype pipeline module to match
the lists.

\subsection{Quality, Debugging, Resources}

This module will require very few resources.
