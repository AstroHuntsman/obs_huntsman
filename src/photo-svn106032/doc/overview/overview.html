<H1>Overview of the Photometric Pipeline: PSP and Frames</H1>
<ADDRESS>December 1996. Photo version: $Name$</ADDRESS>
<hr>

This document gives a quick view of the overall operation of the
Photometric Pipeline.  It should be the equivalent of a short talk,
one in which the speaker mentions the structure of a complex
problem and briefly touches on a number of issues.  It will
not describe exactly how the Pipeline operates --- for that,
you should try looking at the documentation for specific
routines or at the source code.

We have a number of
<A HREF="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/photomisc">technical papers</A>
on photo. These should probably be integrated with this document at some
point.
<P>

This is a first draft, not a finished product.  We intend to
modify it as desired by readers (especially the JPG) who require
more information on specific topics.  Please send any comments
or suggestions to
<A HREF="mailto:ivezic@astro.princeton.edu">Zeljko Ivezic</A>,
<A HREF="mailto:rhl@astro.princeton.edu">Robert Lupton</A>, or
<A HREF="mailto:gk@astro.princeton.edu">Jill Knapp</A>
at Princeton.  With your help, we can improve this document.

<H2><A NAME="getting_started">How to Find Things in Photo</H2>

This document is not a precis of the photo code; if you want
to find out exactly how things are done, you'll want to read the
source.
<P>

To run photo, you'll first have to acquire a standard SDSS environment,
and install all products required to run <CODE>astrotools</CODE> (or
<CODE>photo</CODE> if you don't want to build it yourself). You can
then say <CODE>setup photo</CODE> and proceed to the next paragraph.
<P>

The TCL top-level routines to run the PSP is in
<PRE>
    $PHOTO_DIR/etc/ps_pipeline.tcl
</PRE>
you may want to use cvs to check out your own copy of photo. There's more code
in
<CODE>$PHOTO_DIR/etc/ps_pipeline_procs.tcl</CODE>
and <CODE>$PHOTO_DIR/etc/photo_procs.tcl</CODE>.
<P>

The frames pipeline routines are in the same place, but called
<CODE>frames_pipeline.tcl</CODE> and <CODE>frames_pipeline_procs.tcl</CODE>
<P>

The main routines are called <CODE>run_ps_pipeline</CODE> and
<CODE>run_frames_pipeline</CODE>, and each
expects one argument, the name of the file
that gives the desired order of business, and the location of all
files required to run the <A HREF="planfiles.html#psPlan">postage stamp</A>
or <A HREF="planfiles.html#fpPlan">frames</A> pipeline.
<P>

If you are familiar with emacs' TAGS files, you can profitably say
<CODE>sdssmake tags</CODE> in <CODE>$PHOTO_DIR</CODE> to make browsing
the source easier; tags are built for both C and TCL symbols.
