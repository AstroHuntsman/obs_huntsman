<h1> SDSS Primers </h1>

This area dervish/doc/int (or $INT_DIR)
contains an introduction to SDSS software and some fits files.
Each  file is in a subdirectory that names its subject, along
with some sample files.

<h2> Where this is located </h2>

To access the files used in the examples, use the variable $INT_DIR.
It is set for you when you "setup dervish" and when you run dervish.

Do the following to find these files:

<listing>
fndaub % setup dervish
fndaub % cd $INT_DIR
fndaub % ls -CF
CVS/           help/          primers.html   saodisplay/    style/
doc/           lists/         rcvs/          setup/         tcl/
fits/          pgplot/        regions/       dervish/         whoswho/
</listing>

Read the hypertext version of this document by doing this:
<listing>
fndaub % setup www
fndaub % setenv DISPLAY my_machine_name:0.0
fndaub % xmosaic primers.html &
</listing>
or by accessing it through the SDSS home page, under "Introduction to SDSS."

<p>
The hardcopy is a postScript file, located in $DERVISH_DIR/doc/primers.ps.

<h2> Acknowledgements </h2>
Steve Kent and Robert Brunner supplied text that is incorporated into
these primers.  Many thanks to all who have read and commented on these
primers.  They are doomed to be always "out of date" since s/w 
development is dynamic.  Thanks to all the programmers who are
making this package work, and to all who help me keep
these primers accurate.
