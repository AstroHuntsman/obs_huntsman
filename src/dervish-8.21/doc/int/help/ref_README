	Ok.  Here it is: the HTML Reference Guide, Version .1. 
Following are the instructions for printing the manual.

	Remember, if you like and use this guide, it would be *very
helpful* to hear your comments, suggestions, and corrections.  Send them
to:

	deuelpm@craft.camp.clarkson.edu

	Here's the copyright notice, also found on Page 2 of the HTML
Reference Guide.  Please abide by this notice:

		This compilation may be freely distributed and 
	reproduced with the following restrictions: the work must
	remain unaltered, and no fee may be charged for its distribution 
	or reproduction.

Now that that's out of the way, here we go:



		UNPACKING AND PRINTING THE HTML REFERENCE GUIDE

(Experts' summary: save the message to a file, uudecode, uncompress the
resulting file, then print the pages (see step 5).)

1.  Save these messages in files.  Save the message "odd pages" in a
file called "odd.uu" and "even pages" in "even.uu".  Mailx for unix lets
you use "w # filespec"  where # = message number and filespec = odd.uu
or even.uu.  See your system administrator if you need help saving the
message.

2.  Edit the headers out of "odd.uu" and "even.uu" if necissary.  Remove
any mailing information or explanations I add and save the files.  The
coded part of the file stars with "begin..." and shouldn't have anything
after the last word "end".

3.  Decode the saved files "odd.uu" and "even.uu"  Do this using
uudecode as follows:

	uudecode odd.uu
	uudecode even.uu

If you have trouble with uudecode, see your system administrator.  If
you don't have uudecode, I can send you the uncompressed postscript.  (I
was reluctant to do this for the hundred and some people because of the
size difference odd.uu saves me about 20K, which is significant with big
mailings.  Perhaps I'll revise my thinking on this at a later date.)

4.  Use unix uncompress to unpack the Postscript files.  Do the
following:

	uncompress odd_page.ps.Z
	uncompress evenpage.ps.Z

You should be left with the files "odd_page.ps" and "evenpage.ps"

5.  Send the file "odd_page.ps" to your postscript printer.  Be sure
it's loaded with 8.5" x 11" paper and set up for that size.  **NOTE: 
If you can get your printer to print the first page on the bottom of
the pile, do so.  It'll save you some time in the next step...

6.  Once odd_page.ps prints, it should have a blank page on the top,
page 29 beneath, page 27 beneath, and so forth down to the cover page
"HTML Reference Guide"  If your printer spits out a cover sheet, keep
that beneath the whole pile (so that you won't print a cover sheet on a
book page next pass through).

7.  Take the stack of pages, flip them over, and put them in the paper
tray (tops of pages facing into your printer).  (That is, if you're
holding the pages so that they're readable right side up, pretend
you're holding them and you decide to lay on your back and read them
with your head against the paper tray of the printer.  Drop them on your
face.  Now, instead of your face, drop the stack in the paper tray so
that it has the same orientation.)

8.  Print evenpage.ps.

9.  Cut the pages 7" from the left margin and 8.5" from the bottom
margin (see diagram, below).  (Sorry to those of you who have to convert
this figure to centimeters; the US hasn't come around yet, nor have any
US manufacturers.)

    If you don't cut the document, you'll just have *huge* margins. if
so, don't comment about margin width!  :)

10.  With all the pages in order, staple or bind the book about 1/2" in
from the left margin.  I used staples, they were the handiest.  See
diagram, below, for stapling recommendation (like it matters!  :) ).
