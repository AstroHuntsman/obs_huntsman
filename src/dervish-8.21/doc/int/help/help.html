<h2> ANSWERS </h2>
<listing>
1.  Is there any documentation for SDSS software?

Yes, there is plenty.  Once you learn a few things about where to look for help
files, how to read them, and what is available, then you will find the answers 
to many of your questions.  Much of the documentation was written by people on
SDSS.  Some has been written by people at FNAL for other projects, and the rest
is from people who are not even on the SDSS.  We try to make the documentation
uniformly available.

2.  What is a "doc" directory?

Every product that is set up should have at least one subdirectory that 
contains documents.  For example:

% setup dervish
% cd $DERVISH_DIR
% cd doc

3.  What are all the different kinds of files in these directories?

We try to use the same appendix for the same kind of file.  Here are some 
common types:
	.txt	a plain text file that you can read and print
	.tex	a TeX or LaTeX file that should be processed
	.dvi	an intermediate stage; usually between .tex and .ps
	.ps	postscript; either a document or a picture
	.man	these are formatted to be manual pages.  Sometimes they are
		  in a subdirectory called man/ or manual/, and sometimes
		  they are here.  Often they are accompanied by a .txt file.
	.html	a text file with special directives that are interpreted by
		  hypertext reading programs.  html seems to stand for
		  "Hyper Text Markup Language".


4.  How can I view .txt files?

These are the easiest.  Print them on a normal text printer, or read them on 
screen with a text editor, or UNIX commands such as more.

5.  How can I view .tex or .dvi files?

You can read the .tex file directly, or look at the document it produces.  The
program xdvi is a way to preview the formatted output on the screen before
printing.

6.  How can I view .ps files?

Print them on a postscript printer.  Use a program such as ghostview to 
preview them.

7.  How can I view .man files?

If the MANPATH is set up correctly for you, then the man command will work.
For example:

% setup tcl
% man tcl

Displays the manual pages for tcl.  

% man tcl > temp.txt

produces a temporary text file which can be printed.

If you know the name of a specific file,

% nroff -man $TCL_DIR/doc/TildeSubst.man | more

shows the help for TildeSubst.

The text file tildesubst.txt contains the same information, as plain text.

8.  How can I view .html files?

This is a "hypertext" language.  One way to look at them is to use the xmosaic
program from NCSA:

% setup www
% setup dss
% setenv DISPLAY hostname:0.0  (where hostname is the name of your host)
% xmosaic &
This starts up an xwindow.

The top menu page of this service has pointers into the rest of the 
information:  phot, dervish, ftcl, www, astro, and STScI.  Click on one
of those words to read more.  Help for the xmosaic program itself is available
in the Help selection at the top.  

9.  How can I write a .html file?

One introduction to writing .html is the document called "HTML Reference Guide"
located in $INT_DIR as evenpage.ps and odd_page.ps.


This is example.html

<title>Simple example of an HTML document.</title>
<h1>A simple example.</h1>

This is a simple HTML document.  This is the first
paragraph. <p>

This is the second paragraph.  This is a word in
<i>italics</i>.  This is a word in <b>bold</b>.
Here is an inlined xbm image: <img src="galaxy.xbm">. 
<p>

This is the third paragraph.  Here is a hypertext
link from the word <a href="foo.html">foo</a>
to a document called "foo.html". <p>

<h2>A second-level header.</h2>

Here is a section of text that should show up in a 
fixed-width font (as if it were a computer listing
or a verse of poetry): <p>

<pre>
    The cat in the hat
    fell to the ground and went splat.
</pre>

This is a bulleted list with two items: <p>

<ul>
<li> First item goes here.
<li> Second item goes here.
</ul>

This is the end of my example document. <p>

10.  How can I look at what I have done to see if it looks good?

To view this file with xmosaic, use the command:

% xmosaic $INT_DIR/help/example.html &

11.  What else should I read to learn how to write these files?

While you are using Xmosaic, you can take a look at the .html file that
creates the display.  This is the quickest way to answer the question, "How did
they do that?"

On the menu bar, hold the left button down on File, and drag down to Document
Source.  This will open another window that shows you the plain text source,
with all the html markings, that creates the page  you are looking at.  Since
there are only a few html commands to learn, you can learn most of what you 
need to know by looking at a few of these examples.

Note that when we use links to other files, make the pathname relative to the
home page ( use ../../whatever) rather than an absolute pathname.  This makes
the html files work when they move to different disks or machines.

12.  What are good documents to read?
The style guide, FNAL PN473 can be found in:

% setup www_server
% cd $WWW_SERVER_DIR/doc

The file is called pn473.ps.

A couple of templates, for authors, a "home" page, and an index, are in:

% setup unix_tools
% cd $GENERIC_TOOLS_DIR/template

There is also a reference written by Pete Deuel.  See the file ref_README
and the postscript files evenpage.ps and odd_page.ps in $INT_DIR/help.

13. What about command line help from dervish?

You can access help for most dervish, pgPlot, and TCL commands directly
from the dervish command line using the help command:

dervish> help pgBegin
pgBegin              USAGE: pgBegin [device [xsub ysub]]
                       Begin PGPLOT, open the plot file


dervish> help expr
expr
         expr arg
                 Calls the expression processor  to  evaluate  arg,  and
                 returns  the  result  as  a  string.   See  the section
                 EXPRESSIONS in tcl Man Pages for a detailed description

dervish> help -search=expr -full

(Will search for and print any help text that contains "expr".)

14. Can I define command line help in TCL?

Yes, use the ftclHelpDefine command.

In dervish, you enter:

dervish> ftclHelpDefine facility command helpText

Where facility is the general class of command you are entering.
Command is the TCL command or procedure that you wish to define help for.
helpText is the help string.  You can embed newlines "\n" in it.  The
user can access it via the help text.

For example:

dervish> ftclHelpDefine myPipeLine myCommand "Help for my command"
dervish> help myCommand
myCommand            Help for my command
