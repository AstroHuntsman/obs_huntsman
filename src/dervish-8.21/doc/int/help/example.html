<title>Simple example of an HTML document.</title>
<h1>A simple example.</h1>

This is a simple HTML document.  This is the first
paragraph. <p>

This is the second paragraph.  This is a word in
<i>italics</i>.  This is a word in <b>bold</b>.
Here is an inlined xbm image: <img src="galaxy.xbm">. 
<p>

This is the third paragraph.  Here is a hypertext
link from the word <a href="foo.html">foo</a>
to a document called "foo.html". <p>

<h2>A second-level header.</h2>

Here is a section of text that should show up in a 
fixed-width font (as if it were a computer listing
or a verse of poetry): <p>

<pre>
    The cat in the hat
    fell to the ground and went splat.
</pre>

This is a bulleted list with two items: <p>

<ul>
<li> First item goes here.
<li> Second item goes here.
</ul>

This is the end of my example document. <p>
