 ** FILE:
 **     dervish_template.c
 **
 ** ABSTRACT:
 **     This file contains a template for users writing TCL main programs which
 **     utilize the FSAOimage interface features of Dervish.
 **
 **     The routines invoked by this main program were written to encapsulate
 **     the lower layers of the Dervish, in order to minimize chances of the
 **     template needing changes in the future.
 **
 ** ENVIRONMENT:
 **     ANSI C.
