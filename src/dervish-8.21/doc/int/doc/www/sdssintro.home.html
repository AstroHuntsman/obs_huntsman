<H1>SDSS Introductory Pages are being moved</H1>
A new SDSS introduction home page is under construction and is at a new location.
It is intended for the general Internet public and will provide a basic 
overview of the SDSS project.  The remainder of the SDSS WWW documentation is
also open to the public, but is intended for the astronomers and scientists involved 
in the project.
