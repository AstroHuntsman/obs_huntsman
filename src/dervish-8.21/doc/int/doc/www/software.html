<h2> Software Development Committees </h2>

The document "Software Development for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey" dated 
September 15, 1992 describes "... the following concept for the management 
structure for the SDSS software effort."

<p>
The central responsibility for the overall computing system is to be 
undertaken by a <b> Computing Coordinator </b> who reports to the Survey 
Director.  This person provides the contact between the two software parts.  
The Computing Coordinator moreover requests needed resources from the 
Project Director (via the Survey Director) and allocates these 
resources....  The computing coordinator is advised by two parallel 
committees:
<ul>
<li> The <b> Science Software Advisory Committee (SSAC) </b> is the group 
that is concerned with the science-sensitive part of the software effort.
<li> The <b> Computing Implementation Advisory Committee (CIAC) </b> is 
the group that is concerned with the framework of the data system:  
software, hardware, and the interface issues.
</ul>

The Computing Coordinator is assisted by two Managers:
<ul>
<li>A <b> Science Software Task Manager </b> (SSTM) reports to the Computing 
Coordinator and participates <i> ex officio </i> as the chair of the SSAC.  
This person is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the Project-wide 
science-sensitive software development effort by communicating on a regular 
basis with the implementers of the science modules.

<li>A <b> Computing Implementation and Integration Manager </b> (CIIM) reports
to the Computing Coordinator and participates <i> ex officio </i> as the chair
of the CIAC.  This person is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the 
development of the overall central data processing framework at Fermilab, as 
well as monitoring the assembly and testing of the associated computing 
hardware at Fermilab.  This person also acts as the day-to-day focus of 
communication regarding clarification or more precise definition of 
software interface issues and coding standards.  The CIIM communicates 
directly with the designers and builders of the astronomical instrumentation 
concerning hardware interface issues.  Matters requiring resolution would be 
brought to the attention of the Computing Coordinator.
</ul>
The Survey Director is Richard Kron, the Computing Coordinator is Steve Kent.
The SSTM is Chris Stoughton, and the CIIM is Ruth Pordes.

<h2> Pipeline Coordinators </h2>

The software effort is separated into the following five groups.  Each of the coordinators is responsible for delivering the integrated system to the survey director.

<ul>
<li>Photometric Pipelines:  Heidi Newberg
<li>Monitor Telescope Pipeline:  Jim Annis
<li>Astrometric Pipeline:  Steve Kent
<li>Spectroscopic Pipeline:  Avery Meiksen
<li>Survey Strategy:  Chris Stoughton
</ul>
