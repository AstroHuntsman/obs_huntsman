<H2>Adding an Extension to DERVISH</H2>

Here is a summary of what you must do to use DERVISH to develop a TCL Extension
or "word". It is assumed that DERVISH software has been installed on your
computer.  

<DIR>
<LI>Select a directory in which to develop software. Do NOT develop in the 
DERVISH area itself.

<LI>Issue the command "setup dervish". This gives you environmental variables
pointing to the directories holding the DERVISH include and library files as
well as other software packaged separately, which supports DERVISH, like TCL.
This command also gives you the UNIX command "sdssmake" which is shell
script which drives our makefiles.

<LI>Copy the contents of $DERVISH_DIR/examples into your directory. Choose
a filename for your command. Edit "Makefile" and add the name of the file
with your commands to the line defining the Make macro USERSOURCEFILE.

<LI>Hunt for a file to use as an example. A file that looks at regions is 
called "example.c" in the example area.

<LI>Modify the file as your needs dictate.

<LI>Compile and link your program. Use the UNIX command "sdssmake".
