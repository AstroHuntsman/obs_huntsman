<H1>Dervish Support for FORTRAN code</H1>

<P>
It is imagined that FORTRAN code is black-box numerical code. 
There is no real commitment to providing alot of call-outs 
to the FORTRAN programmer. Rather, we seek to allow code implemented in
the Survey's idiom of FORTRAN to be linked into Dervish.

<P>
Dervish supports this in two ways:

<UL> 
<LI>
The examples directory has code (centered around operate.F) showing how to
integrate FORTRAN into dervish following the Suvery's standards for 
FORTRAN code. Be sure to ape the Makefile as well as the code.
<LI>
Dervish provides FORTRAN bindings for the error routines: 
sh_error, sh_fatal, and sh_debug. 
</UL>

<LISTING>
	CALL SH_ERROR ('AN ERROR OCCURRED')
	CALL SH_FATAL ('A FATAL ERROR OCCURRED')
	CALL SH_DEBUG (1, 'PLEASE NOTICE THAT...')
</LISTING>

The former two routines are called with a character string, the 
latter with a debug level and a character string. See the documentation for
sh_error, sh_fatal and sh_debug. 

<P> HA! there is no C documentaion for these routines. Well, until we write
some, you can tell the C programmers how to call these routines.
