<TITLE>FSAOimage - Fermi Modified SAOimage</TITLE>
<H1>FERMI Modifications to SAOimage</H1>
<P>The following modifications have been made to the SAOimage program to create
FSAOimage.
<UL>
<LI>The display of the current cursor coordinates in the upper left window
of FSAOimage is now in (row, column) format. SAOimage displays the
coordinates in (column, row) format.
<LI>A Fermi cursor has been defined when FSAOimage is put in Cursor mode.
(This is done by hitting the Cursor button in the FSAOimage button menu
panel.) Once FSAOimage is put in cursor mode, it will send the current
coordinates of the cursor to the user program whenever a mouse button
is hit or whenever the CTRL key and a mouse button are hit
concurrently.  DERVISH contains TCL commands to allow the user to define
the action that should be taken when these coordinates are received.
<LI>The labels for cursors are displayed in the format (row,column). SAOimage
displays these labels as (column,row).
<LI>The coordinates of the upper left corner of the image in the main image
display window are 0,0.  The SAOimage default is 1,1.
<LI>DERVISH masks can be displayed over the image.
	<UL>
	<LI>	When saoMaskDisplay is executed, the masked image will be
		displayed.  Toggling between the masked image and unmasked
		image is done with the right mouse button (on a right-handed
		mouse) when in scale (SOP) mode.  [<EM>This takes away one of
		the blink buttons when in scale (SOP) mode.</EM>]
