<P>PGPLOT is a Fortran subroutine
package for drawing simple scientific
graphs on various graphics display devices. It was originally developed
for use with astronomical data reduction programs in the Caltech Astronomy
department.

<P>The PGPLOT routines can be called from a C program following the rules 
for calling fortran routines from <A HREF=dervish.plotting.html#C-Binding>C</A>.
For more information about the PGPLOT available routines and calling 
sequence refer to the PGPLOT manual.

<P>DERVISH defines TCL commands which call PGPLOT routines. The input to
the routines follows the TCL format. Before running DERVISH the DISPLAY
variable must be defined to the correct X display.

<P>Under the $DERVISH_DIR/etc a template TCL procedure file is provided, 
dervishStartup.tcl, which includes definition of a procedure for plotting the
contents of a row or column of a DERVISH region. This procedure is automatically
incorporated by the DERVISH executable.

<P>Note1:  In all calls to PGPLOT routines, if an array is to be specified as 
one of the arguments then it must be defined as a TCL list. 

<P>A 1-dimensional array, a[4], will be specified as follows:
<LISTING>
       {e0 e1 e2 e3}
where:
   the "{}" braces are part of the specification.
   e0, e1, e2, e3 are the values of elements a[0] a[1] a[2] a[3] respectively.

</LISTING>
A 2-dimensional array aa[3][3] should be specified as follows:
<LISTING>
       {{e00 e01 e02} {e10 e11 e12} {e20 e21 e22}}
where:
   the "{}" braces are part of the specification.
   e00      e01      e02      etc are the values of elements
   aa[0][0] aa[0][1] aa[0][2] etc respectively.

</LISTING>

<P>Note2: 
If an argument is to be a function of a variable internal to PGPLOT then
that argument should be enclosed in "{}" brackets in order to avoid evaluation.

<P>Note3:
You might want to look at the documentation for
<a href="tclVectorExpr.html#vectorExprPlot">vectorExprPlot</a>, which can
be used in conjunction with
<a href="tclVectorExpr.html#vectorExprPrint">vectorExprPrint</a> to plot
complicated functions and arrays of floats.
