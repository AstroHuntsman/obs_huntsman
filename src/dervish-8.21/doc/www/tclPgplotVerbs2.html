<H1>PGPLOT Extensions Part II</H1>
<H2><A NAME=pgCons>pgCons</A></H2>
Draws a contour map of an array. The map is truncated if
necessary at the boundaries of the viewport.  Each contour line is
drawn with the current line attributes (color index, style, and
width).  This routine, unlike pgCont, does not draw each contour as a
continuous line, but draws the straight line segments composing each
contour in a random order.  It is thus not suitable for use on pen
plotters, and it usually gives unsatisfactory results with dashed lines.
<P>Calling sequence:
<LISTING>

where:
  a        : 2-dimensional data array.
  i1,i2    : range of first index to be contoured (inclusive).
  j1,j2    : range of second index to be contoured (inclusive).
  c        : 1-dimensional array of contour levels (in the same units as the
             data in array a).
  tr       : 1-dimensional array defining a transformation between the i,j
             grid of the array and the world coordinates. The world 
             coordinates of the array point a(i,j) are given by:
                      x = tr(1) + tr(2)*i + tr(3)*j
                      y = tr(4) + tr(5)*i + tr(6)*j
             Usually tr(3) and tr(5) are zero - unless the
             coordinate transformation involves a rotation or shear.


For example: pgCons a 1 10 2 20 {c-levels} {0 1 0 0 0 1}

<H2><A NAME=pgCont>pgCont</A></H2>
Draws a contour map of an array.  The map is truncated if
necessary at the boundaries of the viewport.  Each contour line
is drawn with the current line attributes (color index, style, and
width); except that if "auto" is specified (see below), the line
style is set by pgCont to 1 (solid) for positive contours or 2
(dashed) for negative contours.

  tr      : 1-dimensional array defining a transformation between the i,j
            grid of the array and the world coordinates.
            The world coordinates of the array point a(i,j)
            are given by:
                     x = tr(1) + tr(2)*i + tr(3)*j
                     y = tr(4) + tr(5)*i + tr(6)*j
            Usually tr(3) and tr(5) are zero - unless the
            coordinate transformation involves a rotation or shear.
auto      : The line-style is chosen automatically as described above. 
current   : The current setting of line-style is used for all the contours.

<H2><A NAME=pgConx>pgConx</A></H2>
Draws a contour map of an array using a user-supplied plotting
routine.  This routine should be used instead of pgCont when the
data are defined on a non-rectangular grid.  pgCont permits only
a linear transformation between the (i,j) grid of the array
and the world coordinate system (x,y), but pgConx permits any
transformation to be used, the transformation being defined by a
user-supplied subroutine. The nature of the contouring algorithm,
however, dictates that the transformation should maintain the
rectangular topology of the grid, although grid-points may be
allowed to coalesce.  As an example of a deformed rectangular
grid, consider data given on the polar grid theta=0.1n(pi/2),
for n=0,1,...,10, and r=0.25m, for m=0,1,..,4. This grid
contains 55 points, of which 11 are coincident at the origin.
The input array for pgConx should be dimensioned (11,5), and
data values should be provided for all 55 elements.  pgConx can
also be used for special applications in which the height of the
contour affects its appearance, e.g., stereoscopic views.

<P>The map is truncated if necessary at the boundaries of the viewport.
Each contour line is drawn with the current line attributes (color
index, style, and width); except that if auto is specified
(see below), the line style is set by pgConx to 1 (solid) for
positive contours or 2 (dashed) for negative contours. 
<P>Calling sequence:

          pgConx &lt;a&gt; &lt;i1&gt; &lt;i2&gt; &lt;j1&gt; &lt;j2&gt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;x-trans&gt; &lt;y-trans&gt;

where:
  a       : 2-dimensional data array.
  i1, i2  : range of first index to be contoured (inclusive).
  j1, j2  : range of second index to be contoured (inclusive).
  c       : i-dimensional array of NC contour levels; dimension at least NC.
  x-trans : x-coordinate transformation.
            The variables x, y and z can be used be the transformation script.
  y_trans : y-coordinate transformation.
            The variables x, y and z can be used be the transformation script.

auto      : The line-style is chosen automatically as described above. 
current   : The current setting of line-style is used for all the contours.

For example:
    pgConx a i1 i2 j1 j2 {c-levels} {$x*cos($y)} {$x*sin($y)}

<H2><A NAME=pgGray>pgGray</A></H2>
Draws gray-scale map of an array in current window. The subsection
of the array 'a' defined by indices (i1:i2, j1:j2) is mapped onto
the view surface world-coordinate system by the transformation
matrix tr. The resulting quadrilateral region is clipped at the edge
of the window and shaded with the shade at each point determined
by the corresponding array value.  The shade is a number in the
range 0 to 1 obtained by linear interpolation between the background
level (bg) and the foreground level (fg), i.e.,
<LISTING>
   shade = [a(i,j) - bg] / [fg - bg]
</LISTING>
<P>The background level bg can be either less than or greater than the
foreground level fg.  Points in the array that are outside the range
bg to fg are assigned shade 0 or 1 as appropriate.

<P>The algorithm used by pgGray is device-dependent.  On devices
that have only two color indices (0 and 1), the background color
is the color assigned to color index 0, the foreground color
is the color assigned to color index 1, and pgGray uses a
"dithering" algorithm to fill in pixels in the two colors, with
the shade (computed as above) determining the faction of pixels
that are assigned color index 1.

<P>On devices that have more than 16 color indices, pgGray may use
color indices outside the range 0-15 to provide more than two
gray shades.  Note that pgGray may change the color representation
of these color indices, but it will not change the representation
of indices 0-15.

<P>On most devices, the shaded region is "opaque", i.e., it obscures
all graphical elements previously drawn in the region. But on
devices that do not have erase capability, the background shade
is "transparent" and allows previously-drawn graphics to show
through.

<P>The transformation matrix tr is used to calculate the world
coordinates of the center of the "cell" that represents each
array element. The world coordinates of the center of the cell
corresponding to array element a(i,j) are given by:
<LISTING>

          x = tr(1) + tr(2)*i + tr(3)*j
          y = tr(4) + tr(5)*i + tr(6)*j

</LISTING>
<P>Usually tr(3) and tr(5) are zero -- unless the coordinate
transformation involves a rotation or shear.  The corners of the
quadrilateral region that is shaded by pgGray are given by
applying this transformation to (i1-0.5,j1-0.5), (i2+0.5, j2+0.5).
<P>Calling sequence:
<LISTING>
          pgGray &lt;a&gt; &lt;i1&gt; &lt;i2&gt; &lt;j1&gt; &lt;j2&gt; &lt;fg&gt; &lt;bg&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
where:
  a        : the 2-dimensional array to be plotted.
  i1, i2   : the inclusive range of the first index (i) to be plotted.
  j1, j2   : the inclusive range of the second index (j) to be plotted.
  fg       : the array value which is to appear with shade 1 ("foreground").
  bg       : the array value which is to appear with shade 0 ("background").
  tr       : a 1-dimensional transformation matrix between array grid and
             world coordinates (tr[6]).

<H2><A NAME=pgHi2d>pgHi2d</A></H2>
Plots a series of cross-sections through a 2D data array.
Each cross-section is plotted as a hidden line histogram.  The plot
can be slanted to give a pseudo-3D effect - if this is done, the
call to pgEnv may have to be changed to allow for the increased x
range that will be needed.
<P>Calling sequence:

             This subset is delimited in the first (x)
             dimension by ix1 and ix2 and the 2nd (y) by iy1
             and iy2, inclusively. Note: iy2 &lt; iy1 is
             permitted, resulting in a plot with the
             cross-sections plotted in reverse Y order.
             However, ix2 must be =&gt; ix1.
  x        : the abscissae of the bins to be plotted. That is,
             x(1) should be the x value for data(ix1,iy1), and
             x should have (ix2-ix1+1) elements.  The program
             has to assume that the x value for data(X,Y) is
             the same for all y.
  ioff     : an offset in array elements applied to successive
             cross-sections to produce a slanted effect.  A
             plot with ioff &gt; 0 slants to the right, one with
             ioff &lt; 0 slants left.
  bias     : a bias value applied to each successive cross-
             section in order to raise it above the previous
             cross-section.  This is in the same units as the data.
  center   : the x values denote the center of the bins
  lowedge  : the x values denote the lower edges (in x) of the bins.

<H2><A NAME=pgHist>pgHist</A></H2>
Draws a histogram of N values of a variable in array
data(1...N) in the range datmin to datmax using nbin bins.  Note
that array elements which fall exactly on the boundary between
two bins will be counted in the higher bin rather than the
lower one; and array elements whose value is less than datmin or
greater than or equal to datmax will not be counted at all.

  datmin   : the minimum data value for the histogram.
  datmax   : the maximum data value for the histogram.
  nbin     : the number of bins to use: the range datmin to
             datmax is divided into nbin equal bins and
             the number of data values in each bin is
             determined by pgHist.  nbin may not exceed 200.
  current  : the histogram is plotted in the current window and viewport
  new      : pgEnv is called automatically by pgHist to start a new plot

<H2><A NAME=pgCurse>pgCurse</A></H2>
Reads the cursor position and a character typed by the user.
The position is returned in world coordinates.  PGCURSE positions
the cursor at the position specified, allows the user to move the
cursor using the joystick or arrow keys or whatever is available on
the device. When he has positioned the cursor, the user types a
single character on the keyboard; 
<P>pgCurse then returns this character and the new cursor position 
(in world coordinates); if the device has no cursor or if some other 
error occurs, the value CHAR(0) [ASCII NULL character] is returned.

 Note: The cursor coordinates (x,y) may be changed by pgCurse even if
       the device has no cursor or if the user does not move the cursor.
       Under these circumstances, the position returned in (x,y) is that of

<H2><A NAME=pgNumb>pgNumb</A></H2>
This routine converts a number into a decimal character
representation. To avoid problems of floating-point roundoff, the
number must be provided as an integer (mm) multiplied by a power of 10
(10**pp).  The output string retains only significant digits of mm,
and will be in either integer format (123), decimal format (0.0123),
or exponential format (1.23x10**5). Standard escape sequences \u, \d
raise the exponent and \\ is used for the multiplication sign.
This routine is used by pgBox to create numeric labels for a plot.
<LISTING>
 Formatting rules:
   (a) Decimal notation (form=1):
       - Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal sign are
         omitted
       - The decimal sign is omitted if there are no digits
         to the right of it
       - When the decimal sign is placed before the first digit
         of the number, a zero is placed before the decimal sign
       - The decimal sign is a period (.)
       - No spaces are placed between digits (ie digits are not
         grouped in threes as they should be)
       - A leading minus (-) is added if the number is negative
   (b) Exponential notation (form=2):
       - The exponent is adjusted to put just one (non-zero)
         digit before the decimal sign
       - The mantissa is formatted as in (a), unless its value is
         1 in which case it and the multiplication sign are omitted
       - If the power of 10 is not zero and the mantissa is not
         zero, an exponent of the form \\10\u[-]nnn is appended,
         where \\ is a multiplication sign (cross), \u is an escape
         sequence to raise the exponent, and as many digits nnn
         are used as needed
   (c) Automatic choice (form=0):
         Decimal notation is used if the absolute value of the
         number is less than 10000 or greater than or equal to
         0.01. Otherwise exponential notation is used.

  form     : controls how the number is formatted:
                    form = 0 -- use either decimal or exponential
                    form = 1 -- use decimal notation
                    form = 2 -- use exponential notation

<H2><A NAME=pgRnd>pgRnd</A></H2>
Routine to find the smallest "round" number larger than x, a
"round" number being 1, 2 or 5 times a power of 10. If X is negative,
pgRnd(x) = -pgRnd(ABS(x)). eg pgRnd(8.7) = 10.0,
pgRnd(-0.4) = -0.5.  If x is zero, the value returned is zero.
This routine is used by pgBox for choosing  tick intervals.
<P>Returns a suitable number of subdivisions for subdividing the "nice" 
number: 2 or 5.
