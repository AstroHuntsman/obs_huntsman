<P>DERVISH regions can be displayed using a <A HREF=fsaoFermiMods.html>FERMI
modified version</A> of the image
display program SAOimage (FSAOimage).  Once an image is displayed, all of the
normal SAOimage commands are still available to the user.  In addition, FERMI
additions allow user defined glyphs to be drawn on the image (circles,
rectangles, arrows etc.) and TCL commands to be defined in DERVISH to execute
when a mouse button is pressed in FSAOimage.  Pressing a mouse button in
FSAOimage will cause the name of the region being displayed, and the row and
column number where the mouse button was pressed to be returned to the user.
Since the user has access to the data that are being displayed (via
<A HREF=tclRegUtils.html>TCL region utilities</A>), TCL procedures can be
written that manipulate data based on mouse clicks.
