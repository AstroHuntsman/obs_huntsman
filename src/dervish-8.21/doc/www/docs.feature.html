<H2>Simple Online Help</H2>

Brief command descriptions are available for most commands in DERVISH. These
are implemented using the "FTCL help facility". It is required than all 
commands implement at least a brief help. More extensive help, and
rationale are available through the Narrative help facilities, described below,

The Help Facility is available using the "help" command and has the
following features:

<LISTING>

help *
	List ALL commands and full messages for them

help cmd
	Show the message text associated with command CMD

help cmd -full
	List ALL available commands

help facil=facil1,facil2
	List Commands associated with FACIL1 and FACIL2

help -search=pattern
	List all commands whose messages contain PATTERN

help -search=pattern -full
	List all commands and help text for commands
	whose messages contain PATTERN.

help -sort
	List all commands sorted by command name

</LISTING>

<H2>World Wide Web</H2>

Long narrative help is available using the World Wide Web system.
This system implements a "web" connected documents using
hypertext The system  supports many word processors and mark-up languages.

<P>Programs called browsers access this information.  Simple browsers which
operate on ordinary files are available. A browser called "xmosaic" was used
to view the  documentation developed for or integrated into DERVISH. A command,
"www" is in TCL DERVISH which starts the "Xmosaic" browser. 

<P>The UNIX command "setup dervish" sets an environmental variable,
"WWW_HOME" to point to a page of hypertext which dispatches to much of
the DERVISH documentation. Having set WWW_HOME to the DERVISH home page,
both the "xmosaic" command from UNIX and the "www" command from TCL
will give you a good starting position to hunt for information.


<H2>Paper Documentation</H2>
 
<P>Hardcopy documentation may be obtained from a www browser, or by
looking in "doc" directories of DERVISH and its component products.
