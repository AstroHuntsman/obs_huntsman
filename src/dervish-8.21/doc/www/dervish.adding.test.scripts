<H1>Guidelines For Adding Test Scripts To Dervish</H1>
<P>

The following guidelines should be used when writing test scripts in Dervish.
Any currently existing test script can be used as a template.  All tests
are run automatically by the Makefile during the build procedure.

<UL>
<LI>All test scripts belong in Dervish's test subdirectory.
<LI>They should be named <B>tst_xxxx.tcl</B>, where xxxx is replaced by
something appropriate to what is being tested.
<LI>The script name should be added to the <EM>SCRIPTS</EM> target in the
Makefile in the same directory.
<LI>Please comment all scripts especially at the top stating what Tcl
extensions are being tested and how.
<LI>Use the <EM>catch</EM> Tcl extension around Dervish Tcl extensions to capture
errors so more informative error messages can be output.  Only Dervish Tcl
extensions that are being tested (or that <EM>may</EM> fail) need this
precaution.
<LI>The test script should not generate any output except on error.
</UL>
