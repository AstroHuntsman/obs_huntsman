CHAINs are defined in the header file <A HREF="../../include/shChain.h"><EM>
shChain.h</EM></A>.
<P>

The Chain Package under DERVISH provides users with a generic container class.
We use the word <I>chain</I> as a synonym for a <I>linked list</I>. We have 
chosen to use <B>chain</B> so as to:
<UL>
<LI> avoid emotional baggage associated with the words <I>lists</I> and
<I>links</I>
<LI> distinguish our linked lists verbs from the TCL primitive <B>list</B>
<LI> be smart alecks
</UL>

A chain is a doubly linked list made up of one or more chain elements. Each 
of these chain elements holds data inserted on the chain. A chain can be a 
<B>homogeneous</B> chain, in which case it holds data of the same type (for 
example a chain of MASKs, REGIONs, PTs, etc), or it can be a 
<B>heterogeneous</B> chain, in which case it can hold data of differing types.

<P>
A chain responds to the following operations:
<UL>
<LI> creation and deletion
<LI> miscalleneous operations 
<UL>
<LI> getting/setting type of a chain
<LI> getting size of a chain
<LI> sorting, joining, and copying a chain
</UL>
<LI> maintaining chains (adding/removing/retreiving/traversing elements)
Two methods are provided for maintaining chains:
<UL>
<LI> <B>indexes</B>. An index is simply a position in the chain. For ease of
use, the chain package provides two predefined indexes, <B>HEAD</B> and 
<B>TAIL</B>. <STRONG>The first element on the chain has an index of 0</STRONG>.
<P>
Sequential operations on a chain using the index method are very
fast since, subscribing to the locality of reference principle, the most
recently accessed element is cached. Thus the entire chain is not traversed
to get to the <I>n+1</I> element after getting the <I>n</I> element.
<P>
<LI> <B>cursors</B>. A cursor can be thought as a context sensitive
device that contains state information for the chain being maintained.
<P>
Any operations on chains can be done using either method, however, the 
usefulness of the cursor method comes in play when the need arises to change
the state of the chain during traversal (add/remove a new/existing element).
Since a cursor contains state information of the chain being traversed, it
can be used to grow or shrink the chain on demand. At present, a chain can
have at most 10 simultaneously active curosrs.

Chain are 0-indexed beasts. Logically, they look like:
