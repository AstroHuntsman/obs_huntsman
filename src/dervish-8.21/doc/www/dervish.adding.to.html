<H1>Adding to Dervish</H1>
<P>

If you are just starting to code in Dervish (adding code or fixing bugs),
the following information is supplied in order to help you
become knowledgeable about the Dervish environment.

<P>
One of the first things you should do is send mail to <EM>sdss-bugs@sdss.fnal.gov</EM>,
asking to be added to the <EM>sdss-dervish</EM> mailing list so you can be
notified of important Dervish events (pig roasts, etc.).  If you have done this
already, you are probably on the list and need not repeat this step.
If after you are done adding things to Dervish you wish to be removed from the
list, send mail to the same address requesting this.
<HR>
<P>
Dervish is coded in strict ANSI C and follows many other coding rules.
This was done (partly) to enable a diverse group of people to work on it and
be able to integrate each other's pieces together in a logical fashion without
making a non-portable hodgepodge.  These
rules are spelled out in detail in the Standards Document or see the summary inSoftware Standards Distillation.

<P>
Many of the coding conventions adopted for Dervish and knowledge gained through
experience are not written down but are
contained as folklore within the heads of people who have been working on
Dervish for awhile.
In order for you to have access to this information, you need to have access
to the people.  Just before starting work on Dervish, talk to Eileen Berman
(Fermilab, berman@sdss.fnal.gov) and she will
tell you (based on what you are doing, who is free and how much you bribe her)
which Dervish expert you should talk to whenever you have questions or need
help.  (If Eileen is not available ;-}, please contact Gary Sergey at
sergey@sdss.fnal.gov.) This person then becomes your <EM>sempai</EM>.  This
person will be
most useful when you plan on making a large modification/addition to Dervish.
When fixing minor bugs or doing maintenance work, you probably will not need
a <EM>sempai</EM> but are welcome to one if you want.
<HR>
<P>Dervish source code is stored in a CVS repository and divided into several
modules to allow checkout of the desired files only.  These separate
modules are as follows -

<UL>
<LI><B>all_dervish</B>         : all of dervish
<LI><B>dervish</B>             : all of dervish except the doc subdirectory
<LI><B>fermitools_dervish</B>  : all of dervish plus the demos
</UL>

You should checkout whichever module best contains the files that you will be
working on.  Most likely, this would be <B>dervish_no_int</B>.  You may want to
familiarize yourself with the CVS summary to learn the most useful CVS commands.

<HR>
<P>
If you want to make a major change/addition to Dervish, you will need to work on
a CVS branch.  This allows you to develop your code without impacting anyone
else who might be working on Dervish.  Similarly, other people making changes to
Dervish will not be interfering with your modifications.  Once your addition is
complete, your <EM>sempai</EM> can help you merge your changes back in to Dervish
on the main line of descent.  Once you have done this a few times, you probably
will become more familiar with all the ins and outs of Dervish and CVS and will
feel comfortable working on your own (then you can become someone's 
<EM>sempai</EM> ;-) ).

<P>
If you fix/add something that is not on the bug/wish list, also send a
description to <EM>sdss-bugs@sdss.fnal.gov</EM>  so it can be included in the
release notes for the next version of Dervish.
